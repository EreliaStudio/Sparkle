## Installation

This section explains how to install the dependencies required for Sparkle and the steps to build and install the Sparkle library on your Windows computer.

### Prerequisites

To build Sparkle on Windows, the following dependencies are required:

1. vcpkg

   Sparkle uses [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) for dependency management. vcpkg will handle the installation of all required libraries specified in the `vcpkg.json` manifest file included in the Sparkle repository.

2. CMake

   CMake version 3.16 or higher is required to configure and build Sparkle.

2. Clang-tidy

   LLVM version 18.1.5 or higher is required to configure and build Sparkle.

### Installing vcpkg

Follow these steps to install vcpkg:

1. Clone the vcpkg repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
```

2. Navigate to the vcpkg directory and bootstrap:
```bash
cd vcpkg
.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
```

3. Set the `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable:
Set the `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable to point to your vcpkg installation directory. This allows CMake to automatically detect vcpkg.
```PowerShell
$env:VCPKG_ROOT = 'C:\path\to\vcpkg'
```
Alternatively, you can add `VCPKG_ROOT` to your system environment variables for persistent usage.

### Installing Clang-tidy

Clang-tidy is distributed as part of the LLVM toolchain. Below are two common methods for installing Clang-tidy on Windows. Make sure that your installed version is **18.1.5 or higher**.

#### Method 1: Install Clang-tidy via the Official LLVM Installer

1. Download
Download the LLVM installer for Windows from the [LLVM releases page](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases).
Choose the version **18.1.5** (or higher).

2. Installation
Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

3. Verification
Verify that Clang-tidy is installed and on your PATH by opening a new terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) and typing:
```bash
clang-tidy --version
```
This should print the Clang-tidy version number. If you see a "not recognized" error, ensure that the LLVM bin folder (e.g., C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin) is added to your PATH environment variable.

#### Method 2: Install Clang-tidy via Chocolatey
If you have Chocolatey installed on your system, you can install LLVM (including Clang-tidy) by running:

```bash
choco install llvm
```

Once installed, verify your Clang-tidy version by running:
```bash
clang-tidy --version
```

#### Environment Configuration
If Clang-tidy is not accessible after installation, you may need to update your PATH environment variable:

1. Open Start and search for "Environment Variables".
2. Click "Edit the system environment variables".
3. In the System Properties dialog, select "Environment Variablesâ€¦".
4. Under System variables, find or create a variable named PATH and append the path to your LLVM bin directory (for example, C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin).

Once Clang-tidy is installed and your environment is configured, you can confirm it is available by running:
```bash
clang-tidy --version
```

### Build and Install

Follow these steps to configure, build, and install Sparkle:

1. Clone the Sparkle repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Sparkle.git
cd Sparkle
```

2. Configure the project with CMake:
```bash
cmake --preset [release/debug/test]
```

3. Build the project:
```bash
cmake --build --preset [release/debug/test]
```

4. Install the library:
```bash
cmake --install build/[release/debug]
```

Note: If you wish to specify a custom installation directory, you can set the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable when configuring (back at instruction 3) like this :
```bash
cmake --preset [release/debug] -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_directory>
```
This will install Sparkle into the specified <install_directory>.

You are now ready to use Sparkle in your projects!

### Using Sparkle in Your Project

To use Sparkle in your project, you need to link against the Sparkle library and include its headers. Below are the steps:

#### Example CMake Setup

Add the following lines to your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
# Find Sparkle package
find_package(Sparkle REQUIRED)

# Link Sparkle to your executable
target_link_libraries(YourProjectName PRIVATE Sparkle::Sparkle)
```
