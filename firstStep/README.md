# First Steps with Sparkle

This directory contains introductory guides for the Sparkle library.

- [Hello Triangle](hello_triangle.md) – start with a window and empty widget, then build shaders,
  buffers, and a uniform colour to render a triangle in the centre of the screen.
- [Simple Calculator](simple_calculator.md) – combine text labels and push buttons to build a
  tiny calculator application.
